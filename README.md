## Quantum Computing Simulator
This repository contains a quantum computing simulator implemented in Python. It allows users to simulate various quantum systems and perform calculations based on quantum principles.

## Simulated Quantum System
The first quantum system described in Section 4.1 is simulated by this project. It consists of a particle confined to a discrete set of positions on a line. The simulator allows specifying the number of positions and a state ket vector by assigning amplitudes.

## Features:
Calculate the probability of finding the particle at a particular position.
If provided with another ket vector, calculate the probability of transitioning from the first vector to the second.

## Programming Challenges Completed (Chapter 4)
1. Transition Amplitude
2. Media and Variance Calculation
3. Eigenvalues and Transition Probability
4.  System Dynamics

## Sample Problems Modeled
The following problems from the textbook are modeled in the library:

4.3.1
4.3.2
4.4.1
4.4.2
